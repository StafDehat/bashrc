bashrc
======

Bash framework to the Rackspace Cloud

Installation:
  Well it's bash, so there's not a whole lot to install.
  That's kinda the point.  To use, simply download onto
  your system, then source the bashrc.bash file.  For
  example:
  # git clone https://github.com/StafDehat/bashrc
  # source ./bashrc/bashrc/bashrc.bash

  This modifies your PATH so you have immediate access
  to all the scripts.  Just type 'brc' and hit tab twice
  to see the various commands available to you.
